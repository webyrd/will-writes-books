Hello, dear reader! I hope you are well.

I have a fancy new keyboard.   The keyboard is a Kenesis Advantage360.  The keys are recessed in a bucket shape.  Sussosedly this makes typing more comfortable, althoughI probably need to type much more to get the benefits.

I am still figuring out how to type using this thing.

I am typing maybe 11 words per minute on a good stretch.

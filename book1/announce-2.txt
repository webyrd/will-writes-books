Yet Another Silent Writing Session

Almost 1 am

Ate, and am now no longer hungry or grumpy.
A little tired still.

My wrists were hurting again when trying to type in different positions.

I ordered a fancy split ergonomic keyboard: a Kenesis with silent MX Cherry keys, and a "normal" key layout, rather than the weirdo recessed buckets of the super high end Kenesis keyboards.  I don't want to have to relearn how to type again.

Keyboard should arrive Friday.  I think I'll try to avoid typing much until then.  I could do a little Emacs and Scheme, but writing 3k words seems Less Good until I get a more ergonomic setup.

I think I'll also get a laptop stand, so I'm looking at the screen at a reasonable height.

Until then, good night!

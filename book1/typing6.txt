This session will make an hour.

Concentrate on accuracy, not speed.

I'm not looking at the keyboard at all.  Slowly getting more accurate, a little at a time.

Wrist pain is currently not a problem.  Wow, I am becoming more accurate.

Let's try increasing the accuracy.

A little improvement at a time.

That one wasn't too bad.

Can I do better?  Certaintly.

Not too shabby!

How many words per minute?

Almost at the hour.

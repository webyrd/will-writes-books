Yes!  I can touch type, just slowly.  Oh, so very slowly...

Maybe I should speed up this video 4x or whatever.

Are we having fun yet?

Mostly got the previous line the first attempt.

It's a long way to the top, if you wanna rock 'n roll...

My accuracy is improving dramatically while touch typing, even if my speed is still sad.  If I can keep improving accuracy, I'm sure speed will follow.

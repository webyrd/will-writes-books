DECISION:

the book is about my kiloTube and milliAsimov challenge to myself

"Of Course" moment getting coffee
trust the "Of Course" moment.  no chickening out!

challenge, not experiment

the book I would have wanted to send back in time to myself, 3 months ago! (or 10 years ago!)

write what I needed to hear in the past, and what I'll almost certainly need to hear in the future

write the book that only I can write

** align what I tell myself I care about and want to do with what I actually spend my time, attention, energy, enthusiasm on **  <= The whole point
*** doing and *finishing* and *releasing to the world* ***
*** about being honest and direct, and finding my own style, and stripping away the unnecessary ***

tie these things to making the kiloTube or the 25 milliAsimov
* create a new relational programming language <-- giving a talk at HFUG Feb 21?
* music <- do a live (or one-take recorded) musical performance, uploaded to my YT
  channel!  At least one per week.
* screenplay or a novel or short stories <- 2 milliAsimov's worth of sci-fi
* physics -- GR, modern understanding of classical mechanics and how related to classical reversible computing; reversible computing <- videos and experiment with language implementation and design
* computer hardware and FPGAs and tape-out an ASIC;
   <= 8-bit Arcade Verilog thingy -- build a classic video game; Steven Hugg book
   <= create a miniKanren Machine and a Scheme Machine
* get over ladder anxiety for SC: Brood War <- record BW ladder games
make recordings of this:
* make a doujinshi on the beauty of computation and sell it at Comiket in Tokyo and/or at ZIN in Akiba
** draw and paint
** Japanese

Go saying: lose your first 100 games as quickly as possible
Make my first 100 bad videos as quickly as possible
Write my first 10 bad books as quickly as possible

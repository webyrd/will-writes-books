Hello, dear reader!

I hope I am getting faster.

This book is about my attempts to instill idiosyncratic and creative thinking in myself.  I present techniques I have found useful personally, always presented in the context of one or more real-life stories.  This book is meta-circular, in that I applied many of these techniques to the writing of the book.

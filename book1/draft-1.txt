In his book, 'Killing the Top Ten Sacred Cows of Publishing,' Dean Wesley Smith points out that for the last few decades--since the end of the "pulps"--the traditional publishing industry has allowed a writer to publish only a few books a year.  Authors who wrote at a faster pace, and who wished to publish their books at a similar rate, were forced to publish under one or more pen names.  With the blossoming of indie publishing, however, a writer can now publish books at the same rate as they write, and the books can be on any topic, and in any genre.

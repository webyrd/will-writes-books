In his book, 'Killing the Top Ten Sacred Cows of Publishing,' Dean Wesley Smith points out that for the last few decades--since the end of the "pulps"--the traditional publishing industry has allowed a writer to publish only a few books a year.  Authors who wrote at a faster pace, and who wished to publish their books at a similar rate, were forced to publish under one or more pen names.  With the blossoming of indie publishing, however, a writer can now publish books at the same rate as they write, and the books can be on any topic, and in any genre.

This observation is directly applicable to my 11 Novel Challenge, of course.  Beyond that, I think a similar argument can be made about public speaking in the age of YouTube.  As a graduate student, no one asked me to give talks on my research, or about Scheme programming.  My first speaking opportunity at Indiana University was one of my own making, when a fellow PhD student and I reserved a classroom so we could give a lecture to a handful of willing students on why we loved Lisp so much.  We had planned an entire series of these rogue lectures, but were shut down almost immediately by an irate department secretary who told us that students weren't allowed to research classrooms.

My next experience lecturing on Scheme was as an Assistant Instructor (that is, teaching assistant) in the introductory computer science course, and then in the introductory programming languages course, at Indiana.  In the beginning I mostly taught recitation/lab sessions for students, tying the lecture material to the home work assignments and exams.  While I found these weekly recitation sessions stimulating, exactly what I could talk about was severely restricted by the needs of the courses, and I only gave one to three sessions a week.

The next opportunity I had to talk about programming languages, Scheme, and what-have-you, was when Roshan James and I attempted to reinvigorate the IU programming languages seminar, under the advisement of Professor Amr Sabry.  Apparently there was a great deal of pent up demand, since PL Wonks grew to be stading room only by the time I left Bloomington.  At PL Wonks students can talk about their research, or perhaps about a paper or language or idea they find exciting.  Still, with so many students, and only 15 weeks in a semester, I could give maybe two Wonks talks a year.

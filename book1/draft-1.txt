In his book, 'Killing the Top Ten Sacred Cows of Publishing,' Dean Wesley Smith points out that for the last few decades--since the end of the "pulps"--the traditional publishing industry would allow a writer to publish only a few books a year.  Authors who wrote faster than this rate, and who wished to publish books at a similar rate, were forced to publish under one or more pen names.  With the blossoming of indie publishing, however, a writer can now publish books at the same rate as they write, and the books can be on any topic, or in any genre.

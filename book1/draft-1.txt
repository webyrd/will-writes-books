In his book, 'Killing the Top Ten Sacred Cows of Publishing,' Dean Wesley Smith points out that for the last few decades--since the end of the "pulps"--the traditional publishing industry has allowed a writer to publish only a few books a year.  Authors who wrote at a faster pace, and who wished to publish their books at a similar rate, were forced to publish under one or more pen names.  With the blossoming of indie publishing, however, a writer can now publish books at the same rate as they write, and the books can be on any topic, and in any genre.

This observation is directly applicable to my 11 Novel Challenge, of course.  Beyond that, I think a similar argument can be made about public speaking in the age of YouTube.  As a graduate student, no one asked me to give talks on my research, or about Scheme programming.  My first speaking opportunity at Indiana University was one of my own making, when a fellow PhD student and I reserved a classroom so we could give a lecture to a handful of willing students on why we loved Lisp so much.  We had planned an entire series of these rogue lectures, but were shut down almost immediately by an irate department secretary who told us that students weren't allowed to research classrooms.

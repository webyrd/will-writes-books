Silent writing session

I wrote for 15 minutes earlier today, but had problems with the video.

My goal right now is to spend one hour "in the chair" each day, regardless of writing speed or topic.  Also, I want to touch type, regardless of speed or accuracy.

I also want to use Emacs commands as I would normally.

For now, fifteen minutes per session is probably enough.

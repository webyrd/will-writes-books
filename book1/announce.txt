Another Silent Writing Session

My goal for the year is 1 million words in the book repo.

This comes out to 3,040 words per day, including today.

These words must be in a *draft* of a book to count.  Notes don't count.  I've decided to be more strict that I had originally described.

Starting with `draft-1.txt`

Today's Word count: 0 / 3040

Writing session: 9:56 pm -- ??    Words: 

Had a slight interruption...  Back to writing
10:59 -- about an hour, with a slight interruption.

Actually, I'm going to end this session for now.  I might write some more tonight.  Depends on external circumstances a bit.  I'll try to start earlier tomorrow.

wc -w draft-1.txt
743 draft-1.txt

So roughly 1/4 my word count.  It's a beginning though.

Good night!

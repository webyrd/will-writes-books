Another Silent Writing Session

My goal for the year is 1 million words in the book repo.

This comes out to 3,040 words per day, including today.

These words must be in a *draft* of a book to count.  Notes don't count.  I've decided to be more strict that I had originally described.

Today's Word count: 0 / 3040

* If something needs to be fixed or updated, or changed throughout the
book, stop, make a pass through the book, and fix it immediately.

* outline to the para, topic sentence, sentence level

* be meta---apply the strats I am using in the video series to writing the book, and include in the book the strats I am using for writing the book, etc.

Lulz-Driven Development rule:
If I lulz, it goes in the book.

Writing the book should be fun and funny.
Reading it, maybe not so much.

When the lulz run out, so do I!

Remember Day[9]: "so stupid, and so funny"

Can I get Day[9] to add this blurb for the book?
I'd settle for "so stupid"

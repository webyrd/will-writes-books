Chapter 1: The Power of Absurdity

[intro para]

Problem: I'm struggling to make one video every two weeks.
Solution: Publically commit to making 1,000 videos this year.
Solution, Part 2 (for Extra Lulz!): After making a handful of videos, increase the number to 2^{10} = 1,024 so I can define a new SI unit: the *kiloTube*.

Problem: For the past 15 years I have started writing dozens of books, only to abandon them within minutes, days, weeks, or months.
Solution: Publically commit to finishing and submitting for publication 11 books in 11 month, and to putting videos of all writing sessions on YouTube.
Solution, Part 2 (for Extra Lulz!): Make the books available on GitHub with a CC BY 4.0 International license, then try to sell the books to commercial or academic publishers!

Slogans:

*** Success is finishing and submitting on deadline ***

Brett Victor: approximately this--the most dangerous thought a
creative person can have is that they know what they are doing

Want to finish the book on time and put it on the market so I can get
that sweet, sweet Creative Commons money!  $$$$

"My next one will be better!"

No practice runs, no holding back the good stuff, etc

Solutions to problems, not excuses

Look forward, move forward

Apply the creativity's book advice to the writing of the book

Write simply and directly, without dancing around with fancy style

Haiku for this book:
Bad advice,
poorly delivered
Boredom ensues!



Strategy for writing the book:

Really meta strat:
Go meta: apply the strategies of the book to the writing of the book,
and include the writing of the book in the book

instance of applying the meta-level strat to the book:
employ the 100:10:1 approach advocated by fogus

possible strats:

4. ** plan quietly, maybe in my head, maybe curled up on my bed or couch with my eyes closed, visualizing and organizing **
=>
2. ** just start writing words **
is it February 29th?
if yes, shop it!
if no, GOTO 4

1. could start from the transcript of my Will Radio YouTube epi, and clean it up
3. create an outline
5. fill up part of a notebook with ideas
6. make a bunch of YouTube videos describing these topics, and transcribe!
7. talk to a rubber duck
8. give a talk on ideosyncratic and creative thinking
9. solicit strategies from Discord and YouTube, etc.
10. hold conversations online with people to exchange stories and ideas

heruristics and rules for this book:
* story-oriented could be strong
* keep it grounded and specific
* things in my direct experience are best




Strategies for Idiosyncratic and Creative Thinking

Olin Meta-advice

nothing precious

Fogus: 100:10:1 

Milos Forman advice to Ed Norton about movie making--almost doesn't matter what your first movie is about

"My brain hurts just thinking about it"
"His lectures make my brain hurt" -- Utah undergrad after my talk in compilers


From Will Radio, Part I -- Strategies for Idiosyncratic and Creative Thinking:

* identify the most promising or standard approaches to a
  problem, and then do anything but that (algorithms class)

* 20 techniques/20 problems (Feynman)

* Cisco's Rule

* Olin's Rule -- standard advice is for standard outcomes
  (Ed Fredkin & reversible computing, kiloTube, miniKanren, most scientific advances, etc.)

* "My next one will be better!" (Ed Wood, at least in the movie)

* find a way to get past your self-censorship and natural aversion to looking foolish
  (kiloTube as a way to get into an work-a-day mindset about making videos; How to Write a Lot)

* succeed epically or fail epically! (kiloTube, H211, my spelling of 'epically')

* Edward Kmett's rule: do the thing people are less likely to believe is true;
  also, anything people laugh at (much of miniKanren)

* the start of becoming good at something is being bad at something
  (see anything I've ever done,
   interesting observation I heard from HB&B:
   one reason kids learn quickly is they are used to being bad at things)

* identify the assumptions people have about a topic, and find ways around them
  (impossibility proofs; on the roof with a chainsaw for cryptanalysis; program synthesis book)

* play! (Feynman; Friday Night Hack Nights and Ignobel Prize)

* play to explore, not to win (game night; StarCraft tournament; Day[9]'s Funday Monday)

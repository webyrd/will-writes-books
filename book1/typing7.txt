Hello, World!

How are you?  I am fine.  Great!  How are you?  Very well, thank you.  What are you up to?

Which day is it?  It is Tuesday.  Cool.

How is your book coming along?  Great!  I am learning how to type.  Uhhh...don't you know how?  Well, sort of, but I am learning a new keyboard layout to reduce my wrist pain when typing.  Oh, I guess that makes sense.  How long will it take you to learn?  I figure it will take me about 3 months.  Hmm, that sounds like a long time.  Not really, given that I haven't written a book in 6 years.

I can see, then, why you would want to learn to type again.  Yep!  Good luck, have fun!

I just remapped my navigation keys!  And I remapped the function key to left control.

I seem more accurate when I don't look at the keys and keep my eyes closed.

Sitting for a long time is uncomfortable, which is probably good.  This time I'm going to keep my eyes closed while typing.  This time I'm going to type while looking at the screen.  Let's try again, with fewer mistakes.  I need to concentrate with all my might.
